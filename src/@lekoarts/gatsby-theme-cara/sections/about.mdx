## About

> Since graduating from Rutgers University with a degree in Vocal Performance I have fully immersed myself in 
> becoming a technically proficient, detail-oriented creative artist. 

In the process, I found that the self-discipline and 
rigorous study of music and foreign languages that were integral to my undergraduate program provided me 
with a strong foundation for moving into this technical field. Moreover, my recent experience in building 
performing arts websites has given me a strong appreciation for the value that internet technology can provide 
any business or professional client. I am eager to continue building upon my skillset and working alongside a 
team in developing new projects!
